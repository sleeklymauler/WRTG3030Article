# WRTG3030Article

The following is a paper I had to write for the Fall 2023 class WRTG 3030: How Science Persuades. The assignment was to write an original 10-12 page article, with the intended audience being academics/scientists within a specific field. The goal was to produce an article that could (theoretically) be published within a scientific research journal.

I chose to write my paper on the various metrics used to measure the performance of single-variable polynomial root-finding algorithms, and how inconsistencies in both the metrics used and the methods used to measure those metrics made it difficult to tell which root-finding algorithms actually performed better than others. I proposed a standardized testing framework including a variety of different metrics with standardized methods to measure those metrics that could be used to better assess the performance of these different algorithms. The target audience was mathematicians in the field of numerical analysis, and the specific field was root-finding algorithms.

Final grade: 32.8 / 35.
